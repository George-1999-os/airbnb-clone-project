## Feature Breakdown

This Airbnb Clone project includes the following core features:

### User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication ensures secure access, while role-based permissions help differentiate between hosts and guests.

### Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, update property details, and manage availability. Each property includes information like title, location, price per night, and images.

### Booking System
Guests can search for available properties, make bookings, and view past and upcoming reservations. The system ensures no double bookings for the same property.

### Review System
After staying at a property, guests can leave reviews and ratings. This helps improve trust and feedback across the platform.

### Payment Integration
Secure payments are handled via supported payment methods (e.g., card, PayPal). Each payment is tied to a booking and includes receipt and status information.

### API Security
The API includes authentication, authorization, and validation mechanisms to protect user data and prevent misuse of the platform.

### CI/CD Integration
The project can be integrated with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions to enable continuous testing and deployment as the codebase evolves.
