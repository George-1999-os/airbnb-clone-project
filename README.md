## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a modern DevOps practice that ensures faster and more reliable software delivery.

###  What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** automatically runs tests and builds the app whenever code is pushed. This ensures early detection of bugs and integration issues.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** deploys the tested application to a staging or production environment without manual intervention.

This approach increases development speed, minimizes errors, and improves product stability.

###  Tools for CI/CD

We plan to use the following tools:

- **GitHub Actions**  to automate workflows like testing, building, and deployment.
- **Docker**  to containerize the application and ensure consistency across environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render** to host and deploy the application reliably.

CI/CD is essential for maintaining code quality, reducing manual work, and enabling rapid feature delivery.
