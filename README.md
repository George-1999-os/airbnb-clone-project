## API Security

Securing the API is essential for protecting the application, users, and data. Below are the key measures we will implement:

###  Authentication
We will use token-based authentication (such as JWT) to verify users' identity. This ensures only authorized users can access protected routes.

###  Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will ensure that users can only access the resources they are allowed to (e.g., hosts vs. guests vs. admins).

###  Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse (e.g., brute force login attempts), we'll limit how many times users can hit the API in a certain period.

###  Data Encryption
All traffic between client and server will be encrypted with HTTPS. Sensitive data like passwords will be hashed before storage.

###  Input Validation & Sanitization
To guard against SQL injection and XSS, all input data will be strictly validated and sanitized.

###  Why Security Matters

- **Protects User Data**  ensures personal info isn't leaked
- **Secures Financial Transactions**  guards against fraud and theft
- **Builds User Trust**  people won't use a platform they can't trust
- **Prevents System Abuse** keeps attackers out
